    "### Using Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, and Age to Classify Heart Disease Patients from Cleveland\n",
    "**Introduction**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Heart (cardiovascular) disease is a term displaying the wide range of heart conditions directly affecting the heart, associated blood vessels, and muscles surrounding the heart (Heart and Stroke Foundation Canada, n.d.). Such effects can result in long-term or short-term effects on the function of the heart itself, spreading to other internal organs. Amongst the range of “heart” diseases, coronary artery disease, commonly found in the United States, is where the patients' blood vessels are narrowed and constricts the amount of blood supplying the heart. There is a multitude of prospective factors that may influence the likelihood of developing coronary artery disease or any variant of cardiovascular disease, including but not limited to, fasting blood sugar, cholesterol, and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased intake of cholesterol can build up inside of the blood vessels and restrict the flow to the heart, brain, lungs and kidneys (Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, 2022). Similarly, studies have observed and indicated fasting blood sugar as an underlying predictor of heart disease and the effects on the heart (National Library of Medicine, 2013). Additionally, the heart is considered a muscle and therefore weakens within aging. Older hearts rest at lower heart rates, which can lead to build up against the lining of the arteries, preventing blood pressure stabilization (Swiner, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to classify and categorize patients on their potential risk in developing heart disease.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The question we will be addressing is: **What is the likelihood of a patient at risk for heart disease based on their cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and age?**"

We will use cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and age as our predictor variables to classify whether the patient is susceptible to heart disease (reasons stated in introduction). We will perform cross-validation, where the overall training dataset is split into a validation and training set, to estimate the current data’s ability to predict unseen data. Cross-validation is important because we can estimate using our available data, meaning no new patient observations are required, and it helps determine the value of K that reduces under/overfitting. Furthermore, we will investigate the classifiers performance based on its accuracy, precision, and recall to conclude if the classifier is useful.\n",
